# Amazon Vine Analysis

### **Overview of Analysis**
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

### **Results**
Our analysis reviews a dataset of reviews for various travel luggages.  
* There were a total 21 vine reviews and 6690 non-vine reviews
* Out of the vine reviews, there were 10 5-star reviews
* Out of the non-vine reviews, there were 3448 5-star reviews
* Vine Reviews: 47.6% were 5-star
* Non-Vine Reviews: 51.5% were 5-star

### **Summary**
As we can see from the above, there is no positivity bias for reviews under the Amazon Vine program. Another recommended analysis is to review if there is any difference in the percentage of 5-star ratings for verified purchases only.
